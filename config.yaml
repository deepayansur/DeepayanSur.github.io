    content: |-
      I am a Computer Science Master's student at USC, specializing in Machine Learning, NLP, and AI-driven systems. My expertise lies in building scalable, data-driven solutions, designing predictive models, and developing NLP systems that drive efficiency and automation.

      With experience in large-scale data processing, model deployment, and AI research, I have worked on user behavior analytics frameworks, enterprise NLP solutions, and high-impact research in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and logical reasoning models. My work has led to a 70% boost in efficiency for data-driven systems, 30% improvements in AI-driven formula generation, and mentorship for 150+ trainees in data engineering and ML workflows.

      Currently, I am actively working on AI-driven synthesis engines and scalable ML pipelines, refining LLM models for structured reasoning, and leveraging deep learning to enhance interpretability in scene-based AI models.

      I am actively seeking full-time roles in Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering for 2025, bringing expertise in AI, data pipelines, NLP, and large-scale analytics to solve real-world challenges.
